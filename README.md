This repository includes the code and technical reports associated with the Bioengineering Measurment, Experimentation, and Statistics Final Project. 

The goal of this project was to use develop a program using MATLAB that could analyze the relationships between various risk factors for cardiovascular disease and disease indicators and systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
using provided data. This data was sourced from the Frammingham Heart Study which is an ongoing, long-term investigation into the causes of cardiovascular disease among a population of freely living individuals in 
Framingham, Massachusetts. 

In order to achieve the goal of the proeject, A comparative analysis of BMI vs. SBP was completed at first. This analysis included creating and studying a single linear regression between the two variables in order to
determine if a direct relationship existed. In addition, a comparative analysis of multiple factors (age, BMI, glucose levels, and total cholesterol levels) to SBP was done, as in reality multiple factors contribute to 
conditions like cardiovascular disease. Using MATLAB software, this analysis was completed generating a multiple regression and visual aids in order to analyze the relationship between the chosen factors.
